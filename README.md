**PYTHON CALCULATOR**

Instructions comprise a keyword and a number that are separated by a space per line. Instructions are loaded from file and results are output to the screen. Any number of Instructions can be specified. Instructions should be the add, divide, multiply and subtract operators, ignoring mathematical precedence. The last instruction should be "apply" and a number (e.g., "apply 3"). The calculator is then initialised with that number and the previous instructions are applied to that number.

*Example instructions*
```
add 2
multiply 3
apply 3

output: 15
```

To run program: `python calculator.py`

To run tests: `py.test test_calculator.py`
